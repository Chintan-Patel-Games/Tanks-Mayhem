# Tanks Mayhem 🚀🔥

**Tanks Mayhem** is a 3D action-packed Unity game where players control tanks and battle in an arena. The project emphasizes clean software architecture, particularly the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** design pattern, to separate game logic, visuals, and user input for better scalability and maintenance.

# 📚 Concepts Demonstrated

- **MVC Pattern** – Separates game logic (Model), UI/graphics (View), and input/controller logic (Controller)
- **Separation of Concerns** – Each component handles a specific role, making the codebase clean and maintainable
- **Object-Oriented Design** – Efficient use of encapsulation and abstraction
- **Game Flow Management** – Organized game states and transitions
- **Tank Movement & Shooting Mechanics** – Player input and projectile logic
